### Hi there and welcome to my GitHub page 👋

My name is Cosmin & I'm a Software Engineer currently based in Cluj-Napoca, Transylvania.

I'm a multi-talented jack-of-all-trades who possess knowledge in the areas of psychology, design, and technology. Able 
to understand business requirements and any technical limitations. I enjoy collaborating with UI/UX designers/creators 
on all processes developing beautiful user interface components and implementing them while also responsible for the 
entire web infrastructure, managing the interchange of data between the server and the users.
